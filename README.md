Student Management System
Project Overview
Welcome to the Student Management System project! This application is designed to streamline the management of student information within an educational institution. Leveraging the power of Hibernate, a robust Java-based ORM framework, this system provides a seamless interface for storing, retrieving, and updating student records in a relational database.

Key Features
Database Integration:

Utilizes SQLite as the underlying database, ensuring a lightweight and portable storage solution.
Implements Hibernate to bridge the gap between Java objects and relational database tables, facilitating efficient data manipulation.
Entity Modeling:

Defines the Student entity class, mapping it to the corresponding database table.
Utilizes Hibernate annotations to establish the relationship between Java objects and database entities.
Basic Operations:IN Mysql

Enables the creation of new student records, including information such as name, age, and Marks.
Demonstrates the retrieval of all students from the database, showcasing the power of Hibernate's query capabilities.
Hibernate Configuration:

Configures Hibernate settings through the hibernate.cfg.xml file, specifying database connection details and other relevant parameters.
